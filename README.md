# Digital Image Tampering Detection / Image Forensics

This project is a web-based forensic tool for detecting digital image tampering. It analyzes uploaded images using various techniques to identify potential manipulation.

## Implemented

The Phase 1 foundation includes:
- **Image Validation**: Proper format and corruption checking.
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**: Multi-quality ELA (90, 95, 98) generation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Basic statistical data from image pixels.
- **Metadata Analysis**: EXIF extraction.
- **Streamlit App**: Dark-themed responsive interface.

Phase 2A adds CASIA-compatible dataset discovery and inspection, forensic feature
extraction, duplicate-grouped train/validation/test splits, and training-only
feature scaling. It does not train a classifier or report model accuracy.

## Dataset Feature Pipeline

Place the CASIA v2.0 dataset under `dataset/` using either the familiar
`dataset/original/` and `dataset/tampered/` folders, or CASIA's `Au/` and `Tp/`
class folders (including when they are nested under a CASIA root folder). The
authentic label is `0` and the tampered label is `1`. Supported file extensions
include JPG/JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and WEBP. No dataset is included in this
repository.

Run the pipeline from the repository root:

```bash
python -m src.dataset_pipeline
```

Optional `--dataset-root`, `--features-dir`, `--evaluation-dir`, and
`--random-state` arguments allow using another dataset location and controlling
the reproducible split. Inspection details, the raw and scaled feature tables,
and extraction failures are written under `results/features/`; split
assignments and the fitted `StandardScaler` artifact are written under
`results/evaluation/`. The scaler is fitted using training rows only. Exact and
perceptually near-duplicate images are kept in the same split. Missing EXIF
metadata is not used as a tampering feature or evidence.

The inspection report counts supported image files, reports detected formats
and dimensions, lists corrupt images and duplicate filenames, and identifies
missing class directories and unsupported files. Failed feature extractions
remain in the feature table with an error status and are also written to a
separate failure table.

Run the focused pipeline tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Use a configured environment that has the packages in `requirements.txt`
installed before running the commands above.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

## Activity 14: Hackathon Preparation

### Team Name: PixelGuard

---

## 1. Activity Objective

The objective of this activity is to prepare for a hackathon by forming a team, selecting a suitable hackathon problem, brainstorming possible solutions, and defining a clear problem statement and technology stack before beginning the development phase.

This preparation focuses on understanding the problem, planning the solution, and assigning responsibilities among team members.

---

## 2. Team Formation

### Team: PixelGuard

| Sl. No. | Team Member               | Roll Number | Primary Role                      |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1       | T S HARSHAVARDHAN NAYAKA  | R25EJ159    | Project Development & Integration |
| 2       | Vighnesh P K KANHIRAKANDI | R25EJ174    | Project Development & Testing     |
| 3       | Terrance Paul S           | R25EJ162    | Project Development & Research    |

### Team Approach

The team will work collaboratively during the hackathon. The responsibilities listed above represent the primary areas of contribution, while members may support one another across development, testing, research, interface work, documentation, and presentation whenever required.

---

## 3. Selected Hackathon

### Semester End Examination Hackathon – Abhinava

**Date:** 07 October 2026
**Duration:** 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM
**Venue:** SVB and SMVB Block

The team selected the Semester End Examination Hackathon – Abhinava as the hackathon for preparation.

The hackathon requires teams to develop a working prototype within the given time period and submit the project files through Git.

### Selected Problem

**Image Tampering Detection: Real vs Edited (Image Processing)**

The selected problem focuses on identifying whether a digital image has been manipulated using techniques such as copy-paste, image splicing, or retouching.

---

## 4. Problem Statement Selection

Before selecting the final problem, the team brainstormed three possible problem ideas.

| Idea                                          | Feasibility | Potential Impact | Decision     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Campus Lost & Found Board                     | High        | High             | Not Selected |
| Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning | Medium–High | High             | Not Selected |
| Image Tampering Detection – Real vs Edited    | High        | High             | **Selected** |

### Reason for Selection

The Image Tampering Detection problem provides a clear and manageable scope for a time-limited hackathon. It allows the team to work with image processing, Error Level Analysis, feature extraction, and machine-learning classification. The output can also be demonstrated visually through an ELA heatmap and a classification result.

---

## 5. Final Problem Statement

Digital images can be manipulated through techniques such as copy-paste, image splicing, and retouching, making it difficult to determine whether an image is authentic or edited. We propose to build an image tampering detection tool that accepts an image as input and analyses it using Error Level Analysis (ELA) to highlight regions with inconsistent compression. Features obtained from the image analysis will be used to train a simple machine-learning classifier to classify an image as real or potentially edited. The system will provide an ELA heatmap and a classification result so that users can visually inspect the image and understand the detected inconsistencies.
